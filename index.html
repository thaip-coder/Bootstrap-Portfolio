                  My full name is Thai Thanh Phan. I was born and raised in Austin, Texas. I attended the University of Texas at San Antonio for pre-pharmacy. Eventually, I discovered that I didn’t want to pursue a career as a pharmacist. After realizing I didn’t really know what I wanted to do, I went back home and attended Austin Community College to save money. After some deliberation, I started on the path to become a nurse. I took the necessary courses, but like pharmacy, found nursing to also be unfit for me. Clearly I was not interested in the medical field. After I quit my pursuit of nursing, I decided to just work and figure things out from there. I did mostly contract delivery jobs for various food deliveries as well as package deliveries for Amazon. I enjoyed the freedom of following my own schedule and choosing when I wanted to work. I did this for a few years and felt that I was becoming stagnant. I was no closer to figuring out a career path than I was when I left nursing behind. So, here I am in this program hoping to create a future for myself.

                  As far as personal information goes, I am of Vietnamese descent. I’m laid back, reserved, but open to talk when spoken to. I try very hard to focus on the task at hand. And, whatever passion I choose to follow, I always endeavor to do it beautifully. My hobbies include video games, tennis, and watching movies/shows. Most video games I play are on the PC, but I also own a switch I play from time to time. Tennis is a very important part of my life. It helps me stay active and is always challenging me to become a better athlete. Genre of movies I enjoy would include horror, action/adventure, comedy, and romance. I’m willing to watch anything that piques my interest, really. When it comes to TV shows I follow the same genre as my movies, but I’m also into Anime and Korean dramas.
